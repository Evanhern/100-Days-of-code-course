Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Repository!

I am currently working through this course on UDemy and I thought it would serve me well to have a repository of all my projects that I do throughout this course 
to track my progress and growth. These projects start very novice and grow in difficulty as new conecpts are introduced. I have some experience with python previously and I 
currently do a lot of automation scripting with in VBA in Excel. I am hoping to grow my skillset by learning Python and SQL. I love process automation work and I hope that I 
can bring this mindset of process automation and process improvement within a Business Intelligence or Data Analyst Roll. These rolls typically look at departments or 
companies at a macro level, which I find very intriguing. I love to problem solve and make processes more efficient within my personal life and my career! I truly believe
that focusing on refining processes no matter how big or small the change is a great mindset to have within business. All companies should have this Kaizen Philosophy applied.
Kaizen is a Japanese term meaning improvement or change for better. I have taken this philsophy and applied it as best I can to my current role by focusing on refining my own 
processes daily. With all of these little refinements made daily it adds up to major improvements. I hope by reading this and looking at my experience you would gather that 
I have a passion for this and I would love to hear any business inquiries via my LinkedIn page. Feel free to connect with me there to chat or ask any clarifying questions!

All the best,
Evan Hernandez
